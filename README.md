# utl_ods_pdf_and_rtf_two_different_page_titles_on_the_same_page
I need two reports with different titles on the same page. If you set 'startpage=no' then multiple procedures can appear on one page, however only one title will be honored. The solution for two titles is to use 'ods text'. You also want the pdf/rtf les to align so that they both span a portrait page.
